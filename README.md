# AlgorithmProblemSolving

## Background

This repository is designed to be my summaries of learning about solving algorithm problems.

Previously I created multiple notes / documents in different tools, such as OneNote, Workflowy etc.; however, it has become difficult to keep everything organized, which is the major reason this repository was created.

Hopefully this will help me centralize all the learnings when I practice solving algorithm problems, as well as that, this could bring benefits to others who is also interested in this topic.
