# AlgorithmProblemSolving

## Background

This repository is designed to be my summaries of learning about solving algorithm problems.

Previously I created multiple notes / documents in different tools, such as OneNote, Workflowy etc.; however, it has become difficult to keep everything organized, which is the major reason this repository was created.

Hopefully this will help me centralize all the learnings when I practice solving algorithm problems, as well as that, this could bring benefits to othersKno who is also interested in this topic.

## Side notes

I will try to find a proper trade-off between "top-down" and "bottom-up" styles to organize the knowledge notes, and for now tend to believe a bottom-up way is more efficient.

It would be easier to write down learnings from each problem and structure the learnings later, compared to coming up overly complex structures and filling knowledge notes into buckets. Anyway, this is a temporary decision and could be adjusted later.
